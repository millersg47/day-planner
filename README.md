# day-planner

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This web application is used to organize the user's workday into hour long segments of time. The user can quickly see where they are in their day based on color coding for each hour block of time. They can also add in notes to each hour block to identify timebound activities. 

The webpage is linked [here](https://millersg47.github.io/day-planner/).

![The day planner application shows the hours of the day between 9 AM and 6 PM broken into hour long blocks. These can be editted to add notes about what needs to be accomplished in each hour. The blocks change color based on the time of day in the user's location.](./assets/day-planner-screenshot.png)
